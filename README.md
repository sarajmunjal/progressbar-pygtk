progressbar-pygtk
=================

Progress bar using PyGTK and threading in Python

This simulates a progress bar based on the execution of the frames.cpp program. 

An output file 'frames' is included in the folder, that simulates an application that is processing frames. 

To run the code, clone the repo, navigate to directory, and then run the following command

    python progressbar.py
    
You should be good to go.
